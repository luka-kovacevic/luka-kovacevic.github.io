Whilst `library()` supports `exclusion` and `include.only` arguments, it can feel a little awkward when dealing with pre-loaded base packages or meta-packages such as the tidyverse, tidymodels and fpp3. Conflicted tells you when you try to use a function whose name is shared by two or more loaded packages. And it offers fine-grained conflict resolution based on your preferences.\n\n## Multi-site Usage Analysis\n\nI'm considering adding a function that would enable analysis of usage across multiple opted-in sites. If you do deploy usedthese within your Quarto website and would be willing to have the site included, then please [raise an issue](https://github.com/cgoo4/usedthese/issues) with your listing page as the title and select the \"usedthese\" label. The listing URL should link to one or more posts which include `used_here()` in the code.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n![](feature.gif){fig-alt=\"A hexagon standing on a blue-curtained stage holding up a CRAN badge.
