Third-year PhD student in Biostatistics at [Clare Hall](https://www.clarehall.cam.ac.uk), and the [MRC Biostatistics Unit](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk) under the supervision of [Professor John Whittaker](https://www.c2d3.cam.ac.uk/directory/29341/professor-john-whittaker) and [Professor Sach Mukherjee](https://www.dzne.de/en/research/research-areas/population-health-sciences/forschungsgruppen/mukherjee/curriculum-vitae/), where I work on causal machine learning methods for genomics. More generally, I'm interested in developing methods for prediction-under-intervention using tools from causality, Bayesian statistics, and machine learning. 

I'm currently visiting [Relation Therapeutics](relationrx.com) as a Machine Learning Research Intern. 

In the past, I've worked on adaptive clinical trial methodology at the MRC BSU and uncertainty quantification for COVID-19 forecasting at the [S3RI](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/research/institutes-centres/statistical-sciences-research-institute-s3ri) in collaboration with PHE and Dstl. I obtained an MSc in Statistical Science from the University of Oxford and a BSc in Mathematics with Computer Science from the University of Southampton.
