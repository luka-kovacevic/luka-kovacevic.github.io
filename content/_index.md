## Luka's Site

I'm a third-year PhD student in Biostatistics at [Clare Hall](https://www.clarehall.cam.ac.uk), and the [MRC Biostatistics Unit](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk) under the supervision of [Professor John Whittaker](https://www.c2d3.cam.ac.uk/directory/29341/professor-john-whittaker) and [Professor Sach Mukherjee](https://www.dzne.de/en/research/research-areas/population-health-sciences/forschungsgruppen/mukherjee/curriculum-vitae/), where I work on causal machine learning methods for genomics. My interests are in developing methods for predicting effects of interventions using tools from causality, Bayesian statistics, and machine learning.

I'm currently visiting [Relation Therapeutics](https://relationrx.com) as a Machine Learning Research Intern. 

In the past, I've worked on adaptive clinical trial methodology at the MRC BSU and uncertainty quantification for COVID-19 forecasting at the [S3RI](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/research/institutes-centres/statistical-sciences-research-institute-s3ri) in collaboration with PHE and Dstl. I hold an MSc in Statistical Science from the University of Oxford and a BSc in Mathematics with Computer Science from the University of Southampton.

This space is where I write about statistics, travels, and books. I also sometimes write [code](https://github.com/luka-kovacevic) and [papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JrrCIW4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
